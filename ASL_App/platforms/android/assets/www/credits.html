                        Jordan Asman created this app for her High School Senior AP Research capstone <br>
                        project. She wanted to accommodate the Deaf community in museum attractions, <br>
                        so she thought the best way to do this would be to create her own app. She <br>
                        used her background in American Sign Language along with her math and science <br>
                        skills to create this app. She wanted to make sure that the app had proper <br>
                        ASL word order, so she translated and recorded the videos herself. She hopes <br>
                        that this app is helpful and that you enjoy using it.
