    Jordan Asman created this app for her Senior AP Research capstone project. <br>
    She wanted to accommodate the Deaf community in museum attractions, so she <br>
    thought the best way to do this would be to create her own app. She used her <br>
    background in American Sign Language along with her math and science skills <br>
    to create this app. She wanted to make sure that the app had proper ASL word <br>
    order, so she translated and recorded the videos herself. She hopes that this <br>
    app is helpful and that you enjoy using it.
